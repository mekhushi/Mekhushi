### 🌸 About Me

I'm Khushiee — a 2nd-year engineering student, passionate about building **real-world projects** that blend 💡 intelligence with 🎯 impact.  

Whether it's physics-inspired simulations, sustainability apps, or accessibility tools — I love using **AI, ML, and code** to solve problems that matter.

- 👩‍💻 Mostly working solo, learning in public  
- 💚 Strong believer in clarity, kindness, and code with character  
- ✨ Projects > Buzzwords. Effort > Followers.
